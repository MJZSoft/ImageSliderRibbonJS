# ImageSliderRibbonJS
This JavaScript library models image slider ribbon feature of Flash with pure JavaScript code.

Here is a snapshot of a sample output of the library.

Long time ago (in 2012) I visited a website with the following address:

http://www.bishopimage.com/artList/index.html

They had a very beautiful image slider inside of their website as a banner. Currently, they changed the website design and if you go to the above address mostly you cannot visit the image slider that I saw. Thus, I made a video from their website which you can find it at the following address:

This was a pretty good encouragement for me to create a pure JavaScript library that does the same work. ImageSliderRibbonJS is a pure lightweight JavaScript library that helps you to create beautiful banners for your website.

The source of the images that were used inside of this project is http://bishop.digital/.

If you need to know how to use the library just clone it and open the index.html file with a browser.
